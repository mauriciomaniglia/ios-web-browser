Web browser for iOS

I'm not a browser specialist and I have no idea how a web browser works(very roughly), but I want to use this project to study how web browsers work, I mean, the client. 

I'm using Firefox, Brave, and Duckduckgo open-source projects as a base for this study. The main idea here it's besides creating this project which I think is cool is also an opportunity to apply good software principles so I'm not going to rush here just for the sake of creating a browser. 

I'm also going to create another project for the macOS client so this will be an opportunity for me to study AppKit which I never have used before. Also, it will be a good exercise for creating components that can be reused on other platforms. So I'm planning to create three repositories, one for iOS, another one for mac, and one that will have all the share logic. Maybe I could create other repositories but by now I'm just gonna stick with those. 

## TODO
This is a very basic to-do list with things that I'm thinking about right now. I will eventually update this list as I progress in my journey.
